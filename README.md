# Mobile Flashcards 
> Udacity React Nanodegree Project 3

## The Setup

* `git clone https://github.com/alizenguyen/mobile_flashcards.git`
* cd to correlating folder
* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
* follow onscreen instruction to open app (both platforms have been tested)

## Future improvements

Due to time constraints, only the bare minimun was done to follow the rubric.
Styling and organizing will be added in the future.
